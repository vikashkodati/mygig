Built with modularity as a core principle, eoAPI can easily be customized to your needs.\n\n#### Additional resources\n\n- eoAPI homepage: <https://eoapi.dev>","metadata":{},"attachments":{}},{"id":"1f844b8c-ebd2-405f-aee2-318aa6f177a5","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.2 Why would you use eoAPI?\n\n- You want to make your data catalog easily searchable for internal and/or external users \n- You want to serve dynamic visualizations of collections in data catalog\n- You want to use the growing list of tools and frameworks that can consume STAC metadata","metadata":{}},{"id":"2d267c76-1777-4d36-9a20-b7e2bc65edd2","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

Tradiditional workflows are still possible with the eoAPI stack, though. For example, if your users still want to download files to their own disk they can use the STAC API to search for the items they need then use the download links for the assets in each item.\n\n#### Additional resources\n\n- Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum: <https://cloudnativegeo.org/>\n- Cloud-Optimized Geospatial Formats Guide: <https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/>","metadata":{}},{"id":"ddc8f833-f7d1-4776-ad58-ad6aaf30f84b","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.2 Infrastructure as Code\n\nA key concept for reliable and reproducible cloud resource deployments is **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, which:\n- Defines your infrastructure in code files rather than manual configuration in a web portal\n- Makes deployments reproducible and versioned\n- Enables easy scaling and updates\n- Enables review of proposed changes via code review\n\neoAPI provides IaC templates for [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)","metadata":{}},{"id":"ab9a51ff-80f1-49ac-be58-f80b8cbbe9d3","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.

3.1 What is STAC?\n\nThe SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification is a common language for describing geospatial data:\n\n- **Simple**: Based on JSON, a widely-used data format\n- **Extensible**: Core specification with optional extensions\n- **Self-describing**: Contains both metadata and links to data\n- **Hierarchical**: Collections contain items which reference assets (the actual data files)\n\nSTAC helps solve a fundamental problem: making Earth observation data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR principles).\n\n#### Additional resources\n\n- STAC

**Asset**: The actual data file (e.g., GeoTIFF, NetCDF, etc.)\n\nHere's a simplified representation:\n\n```\nCatalog\n├── Collection A\n│   ├── Item 1\n│   │   ├── Asset 1 (e.g., visual.tif)\n│   │

production deployments on AWS, use [eoapi-cdk](https://github.com/developmentseed.org/eoapi-cdk):\n\n- Deploys a pgstac database to AWS' Relational Database Service (RDS) with an EC2 instance running `pgbouncer` for connection pooling\n- Deploys stac-fastapi-pgstac, titiler-pgstac, and tipg as serverless Lambda functions\n- Sets up API Gateway endpoints for the REST APIs\n- Handles permissions and networking between the services\n\n#### Advantages\n- Lowest cost deployment option\n- Autoscaling: serverless functions that spin up when you need them, turn off when you aren't using them\n- Most mature eoAPI deployment system available\n\n#### Disadvantages\n- Locked into AWS\n- Serverless functions can take be slow to warm up from a cold
